Hey there,

> Thank you for downloading this vault. 

This vault is the compilation of useful CSS snippets that will help you personalize the look and feel in obsidian that is more aligned with your personality and work style. 

These CSS snippets are collected from Reddit, Obsidian forum and Obsidian Discord. 

If you want to see what the different snippets are or how they work, and more guides, you can check out [this original article](https://beingpax.medium.com/27-awesome-css-snippets-for-customizing-obsidian-9d64114f3284) I wrote on this. You can visit the source for individual CSS snippets if you need more info.
