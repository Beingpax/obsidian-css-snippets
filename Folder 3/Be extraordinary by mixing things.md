alias: Be extraordinary by mixing things
---
If you want to be extraordinary at something, there are two paths you can choose; become the best at one thing, which is near to impossible or be a combination of two or more things. 

When you combine multiple things, you become rare and unique. You are easily differentiated from others. Different skills individually won't make you look different, but when combined together makes a strong package. 

Being a critic is easy. It's easy to criticize someone from the comfort of your couch eating doritos. 

But creating something, and shipping it to the world requires a lot of effort. 

As a builder, your job is to create a vision. There will always be critics who will be ready to tear it down. 

It's easy to just consume and yell at others but creating something is difficult.
