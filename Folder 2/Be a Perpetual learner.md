Life never stops teaching you. If you accept that and never let anything stop you from learning, you can get way ahead in life. 

Being a perpetual learner is the most important skill for getting rich. You have to know how to learn anything you want. Now you have to be a fast learner because most of things you know today will be obsolete four years later.

You can learn almost anything. It's like hitting the gym. When you read, and read, and read, you will make strong mental muscles. You have to learn the right things in right order. 

If you go into 1-2 things that you are really obsessed with and master them, you will becom unstoppable. 

Work ethic won't make you rich. Hardwork won't make you rich. What's more important is the direction you are working in.

Therefore, you can't depend upon the old ways of making money by going to school, getting degree and working for thirty years. This will never put you on a path to financial success. You have to adopt a mindset of a perpetual learner.
