You procrastinate because you don't like the feeling of doing something. Boredom, difficulty and any emotional discomfort triggers procrastination.

The best way to beat procrastination is to go against your feelings. Most people avoid certain tasks not because they are difficult but because of their exaggeration of how bad it really would be. 

So, instead of thinking too much, start by taking the smallest step possible. This helps often. And you'll realize this most often that, the thing you were trying to avoid might not be as frightening as you expected.
